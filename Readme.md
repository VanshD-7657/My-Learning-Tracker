## 📖 About This Repository

Welcome to my personal accountability log. 

I created this repository not just to store code, but to **build character**. My goal is to become a world-class Data Scientist, and I believe that talent is nothing without **discipline**. 

This repository serves as a mirror of my daily efforts. It is where I track my learning, my coding streaks, and my honest reflection on my progress.

### 🌟 My Core Values
> *"I am too honest because I love to give time to myself to make me better."*

* **💯 Radical Honesty:** If I didn't study, I mark it. If I failed, I write it down. Real progress starts with the truth.
* **🔥 Unwavering Discipline:** Motivation gets you started; habit keeps you going. I am building the habit.
* **📈 Continuous Growth:** My only competition is who I was yesterday. I strive to be 1% better every single day.
* **🎯 Commitment:** I have goals, and this repository is the proof that I am working towards them.
